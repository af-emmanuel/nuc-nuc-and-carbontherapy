# nuc-nuc-and-carbontherapy
This repository represents simulations, computations and data analysis done with respect to a research on 
the impact of nucleus-nucleus collision models in carbon therapy.
#the Callingscheme folder contains the geant4 simulation files while the LEM and MKM folders 
contain the computation files using the survival softwares, and the data analysis files using root(cern). 
I hope I to refine this repository to aid better comprehension by users. However, if you take each folder as it is you might be able to modify a few things to achive your aim, 
provided you have understood how the survival software and the Geant4 toolkit work.
