# nuc-nuc-and-carbontherapy
This repository represents simulations, computations and data analysis done with respect to a research on 
the impact of nucleus-nucleus collision models in carbon therapy.
#the calling scheme folder is contains the geant4 simulation files while the other two files with LEM and MKM at their ends, 
represent the folder containing the computations using the survival softwares, and data analysis using root(cern). 
I hope I will have time to refine this repository for better comprehension for users. However, if you take each folder as it is you might be able to modify a few things to achive your aim, 
provided you have understood how the survival software and the Geaant4 toolkit work.
